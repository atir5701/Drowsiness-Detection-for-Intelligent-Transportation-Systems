Implemented Federated learning to train CNN models on the local dataset to ensure data privacy. Integrated detection outputs into a blockchain-based smart contract for secure data storage and penalties enforcement. The global modelâ€™s accuracy stabilizes around 97.45% by using Adam as an optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001.
